An input component for tracking durations of time. It supports various configurations from weeks to seconds.

## Installation

Install from NPM:

```shell
npm install @brightspace-ui-labs/input-duration
```

## Usage

```html
<script type="module">
    import '@brightspace-ui-labs/input-duration/input-duration.js';
</script>
<d2l-labs-input-duration
    label="Duration"
    units="hours:minutes"
></d2l-labs-input-duration>
```

**Properties:**

| Property | Type | Description |
|--|--|--|
| `label` | String, required | Label for the input |
| `label-hidden` | Boolean | Hides the label visually |
| `units` | String, required | A colon (`:`) delimited list of the units to use (ex: `hours:minutes`). Supported units are `weeks` `days` `hours` `minutes` `seconds`. |
| `largest-unit-max` | Number, default: `99` | Sets the max number for the largest unit of the selected set |
| `weeks` | Number | Value of weeks for the input |
| `days` | Number | Value of days for the input |
| `hours` | Number | Value of hours for the input |
| `minutes` | Number | Value of minutes for the input |
| `seconds` | Number | Value of seconds for the input |
| `disabled` | Boolean | Disables the input |
| `error` | Boolean | Sets the input into an error state |

**Accessibility:**

To make your usage of `d2l-labs-input-duration` accessible, use the following properties when applicable:

| Attribute | Description |
|--|--|
| `label` | **REQUIRED**  [Acts as a primary label on the input](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/labels/). Visible unless `label-hidden` is also used. |
| `label-hidden` | Use if label should be visually hidden but available for screen reader users |

**Events:**

* `change`: Dispatched whenever a value changes for any of the units within the input. The event detail (`event.detail`) is an object containing the updated values for each unit (ex: an input with `weeks:days:hours:minutes:seconds` might have an `event.detail` like this: `{ weeks: 2, days: 5, hours: 10, minutes: 30, seconds: 0 }`).

## Developing, Testing and Contributing

After cloning the repo, run `npm install` to install dependencies.

### Linting

```shell
# eslint and lit-analyzer
npm run lint

# eslint only
npm run lint:eslint
```

### Testing

```shell
# lint & run headless unit tests
npm test

# unit tests only
npm run test:headless

# debug or run a subset of local unit tests
# then navigate to `http://localhost:9876/debug.html`
npm run test:headless:watch
```

### Visual Diff Testing

This repo uses the [@brightspace-ui/visual-diff utility](https://github.com/BrightspaceUI/visual-diff/) to compare current snapshots against a set of golden snapshots stored in source control.

The golden snapshots in source control must be updated by the [visual-diff GitHub Action](https://github.com/BrightspaceUI/actions/tree/main/visual-diff).  If a pull request results in visual differences, a draft pull request with the new goldens will automatically be opened against its branch.

To run the tests locally to help troubleshoot or develop new tests, first install these dependencies:

```shell
npm install @brightspace-ui/visual-diff@X mocha@Y puppeteer@Z  --no-save
```

Replace `X`, `Y` and `Z` with [the current versions](https://github.com/BrightspaceUI/actions/tree/main/visual-diff#current-dependency-versions) the action is using.

Then run the tests:

```shell
# run visual-diff tests
npx mocha './test/**/*.visual-diff.js' -t 10000
# subset of visual-diff tests:
npx mocha './test/**/*.visual-diff.js' -t 10000 -g some-pattern
# update visual-diff goldens
npx mocha './test/**/*.visual-diff.js' -t 10000 --golden
```

### Running the demos

To start a [@web/dev-server](https://modern-web.dev/docs/dev-server/overview/) that hosts the demo page and tests:

```shell
npm start
```

## Versioning & Releasing

> TL;DR: Commits prefixed with `fix:` and `feat:` will trigger patch and minor releases when merged to `main`. Read on for more details...

The [sematic-release GitHub Action](https://github.com/BrightspaceUI/actions/tree/main/semantic-release) is called from the `release.yml` GitHub Action workflow to handle version changes and releasing.

### Version Changes

All version changes should obey [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) rules:
1. **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes,
2. **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
3. **PATCH** version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

The next version number will be determined from the commit messages since the previous release. Our semantic-release configuration uses the [Angular convention](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/tree/master/packages/conventional-changelog-angular) when analyzing commits:
* Commits which are prefixed with `fix:` or `perf:` will trigger a `patch` release. Example: `fix: validate input before using`
* Commits which are prefixed with `feat:` will trigger a `minor` release. Example: `feat: add toggle() method`
* To trigger a MAJOR release, include `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space or two newlines in the footer of the commit message
* Other suggested prefixes which will **NOT** trigger a release: `build:`, `ci:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:` and `test:`. Example: `docs: adding README for new component`

To revert a change, add the `revert:` prefix to the original commit message. This will cause the reverted change to be omitted from the release notes. Example: `revert: fix: validate input before using`.

### Releases

When a release is triggered, it will:
* Update the version in `package.json`
* Tag the commit
* Create a GitHub release (including release notes)
* Deploy a new package to NPM

### Releasing from Maintenance Branches

Occasionally you'll want to backport a feature or bug fix to an older release. `semantic-release` refers to these as [maintenance branches](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/usage/workflow-configuration#maintenance-branches).

Maintenance branch names should be of the form: `+([0-9])?(.{+([0-9]),x}).x`.

Regular expressions are complicated, but this essentially means branch names should look like:
* `1.15.x` for patch releases on top of the `1.15` release (after version `1.16` exists)
* `2.x` for feature releases on top of the `2` release (after version `3` exists)
